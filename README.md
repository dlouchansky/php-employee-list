Simple employee list is a test assignment, which i made for one web development company some time ago.

Requirements were: don't use any frameworks (only pure PHP, CSS, JavaScript, HTML), try to make the task in 3 hours.

The task took me 5 hours and one more hour for refactoring. No JavaScript written, because it would take me another 2 hours.

I've made simple MVC with front controller pattern, nuff said. Oh, and UI is in Ð¯ussian.
